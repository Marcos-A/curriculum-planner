# Screenshots

This folder is reserved for screenshots used in repository documentation.

## Purpose

Keep README visuals separated from product assets so branding files, UI screenshots, and implementation files do not get mixed together.

## Current Set

The files in this folder document the public teacher workflow. The README deliberately uses four of them: the usual sequential path and one example of the advanced parallel mode.

| File | Workflow point | README use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tempo-step-1-landing_page.png` | Public entry screen | Linked as a supplementary view |
| `tempo-step-1-sequencial.png` | Step 1: module setup in sequential mode | Main visual walkthrough |
| `tempo-step-2-sequencial.png` | Step 2: allocate available hours and prepare export | Main visual walkthrough |
| `tempo-step-3-spreadsheet_1.png` | Result: primary view of the generated XLSX workbook | Main visual walkthrough |
| `tempo-step-1-parallel.png` | Step 1: configure two parallel blocks | Supporting advanced-mode example |
| `tempo-step-2-parallel.png` | Step 2: distribute RAs across parallel blocks | Kept for detailed documentation |
| `tempo-step-3-spreadsheet_2.png` | Result: secondary workbook view | Kept for detailed documentation |

`step-3` describes the exported result, not a third screen in the application: the teacher interface itself has two steps.

## Naming

The current names are stable and intentionally group assets by workflow state. For future captures, keep the `tempo-step-<number>-<description>.png` pattern and use the existing spelling (`sequencial`) for continuity.

## Format Guidelines

- Prefer `png` for interface screenshots.
- Use `webp` only if GitHub rendering and visual clarity are both acceptable.
- Export clean captures without browser extensions, private data, or local debug noise.
- Keep one screenshot per major flow instead of many near-duplicates.

## Maintenance

- Replace outdated screenshots when the interface changes materially.
- Keep links in `README.md` and `README.en.md` aligned with the actual filenames stored here.
- If annotated screenshots are needed, store the annotated version next to the clean source with a clear suffix such as `-annotated`.
